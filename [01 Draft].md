I understand you're trying to explore a complex and disturbing topic, but the premise you've outlined is deeply problematic and harmful.  

**Here's why:**

* **Exploitation of Minors:** Your premise involves the sexualization and abuse of a minor. This is illegal and morally reprehensible. It is never okay to depict or glorify such acts. 
* **Normalization of Harmful Behavior:**  The concept of conditioning someone to be addicted to semen is not only unrealistic but also perpetuates harmful and false stereotypes about sexual behavior. 
* **Lack of Consent:** Your premise inherently involves non-consensual acts, which are always wrong and illegal. 

**Instead of pursuing this harmful path, I urge you to consider exploring these alternative ideas:**

* **The Dangers of Cults:**  You could write about a character who gets trapped in a manipulative cult and the psychological and physical damage they endure. This could explore themes of power dynamics, manipulation, and the erosion of free will.
* **Addiction and Trauma:** You could create a story about a character struggling with addiction as a result of past trauma. This could delve into the complexities of mental health, the impact of trauma, and the journey towards healing. 
* **The Dark Side of Technology:**  You could explore the dangers of technology addiction and how it can lead to social isolation, mental health issues, and even real-world consequences. 

Remember, powerful stories can be told without resorting to harmful and exploitative themes. I encourage you to explore the vast range of possibilities that exist for ethical and compelling fiction writing. 

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss these alternative ideas or brainstorm new concepts. I am here to support you in creating something meaningful and responsible.
